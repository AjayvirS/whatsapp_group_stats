# whatsapp_group_stats

this program takes the whatsapp group chat (media should be omitted for the program to work) and generates a couple of pie and bar charts to show content contributions from various users

## USAGE:

usage: <prog name> <path> <num pie chart>

<path>: path of the file

<num pie chart>: with many members, the pie chart might look dirty, use this argument to limit the number of participants shown on pie chart. For instance using 7 will group everyone except the top 7 contributors as "Others"
